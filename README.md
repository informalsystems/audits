# Informal Audits

Informal Systems apply a multi-layered, automated approach to our security
audits for the blockchain ecosystem. Under the guidance of leading researchers
in protocol design, verification, and testing, we leverage
our formal verification tools -- including
[Apalache](https://apalache.informal.systems/) and [Model-Based
Testing](https://github.com/informalsystems/modelator) -- to make distributed
systems secure and resilient.
