## Attribution Guidelines

When citing or referencing materials published by Informal Systems, Inc., it is
critical to ensure accurate and appropriate attribution. Below are the
guidelines for proper attribution:

- **Do Not Generalize Findings:** Our security audit reports are limited to the specific scope and components reviewed at the time of the audit. They should not be used to assert or imply that an entire codebase or system is secure. Instead, references should explicitly note the scope of the audit as defined in the report.

- **Required Language:** When citing a report, use the following attribution language:

> "This report, prepared by Informal Systems, Inc., provides findings from a security audit conducted on [specific project/component] as of [date]. The findings are limited to the scope outlined in the report and do not imply complete security of the overall system."

- **Proper Credit:** Always attribute Informal Systems, Inc., as the author of the work, and include a link to the original publication to ensure proper context.

- **Avoid Misrepresentation:** Do not use our findings to claim compliance, certification, or complete security of a system unless explicitly stated in the report.

- **Fair Use of Excerpts:** Excerpts from our reports may be used provided they are accurate, not taken out of context, and include proper attribution as outlined above.

These guidelines are designed to preserve the integrity of our work and prevent
misunderstandings or misuses of our findings. If you have any questions about
appropriate attribution, please contact your project manager.
