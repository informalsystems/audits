# Engagement Goals

This audit was scoped by the Informal Systems team in order to assess the
correctness and security of the Injective Protocol. It was planned along two
Milestones. In the first milestone, the focus was to get familiarized with the
codebase and look for potential attack vectors in the spot markets. In the
second milestone, the focus was on derivative markets. As the scope of the
project is too large for a short-term audit, we agreed that it was not feasible
to acquire comprehensive understanding of the protocols and system
functionality. Instead, we focused on potential attack scenarios by inspecting
the code and running model-based tests.
