# Coverage

Informal Systems manually reviewed the documentation and code of the software
in the [Injective Chain
directory](https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/injective-core/tree/dev/injective-chain)
starting at commit hash 4dac628eb1d08f4d66685e9f228f6ff53e9197c9. As the code
was updated during the review, we continued with further commits through
baa69e1c366e9dc8727c7385fa120c08162b08e0.

We focused on the backend Cosmos code in the modules: `exchange`, `insurance`,
and `oracle`. As the codebase spans over 38 KLOC of Golang code, we could not
perform an exhaustive audit of the whole codebase.
